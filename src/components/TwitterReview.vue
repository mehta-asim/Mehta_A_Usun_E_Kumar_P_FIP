        Weâ€™re excited to announce a new partnership with the Wikipedia Library,
        a project of the nonprofit @Wikimedia, which will connect @Wikipedia
        editors with full-text access to Wiley Online Library.

        "Visuals are critical to sharing knowledge and illuminating untold
        stories." Wikimedia Creative Director @kahnyee_ chats with @business24gh
        about the #WikiUnseen project and our efforts to close the visual
        knowledge gaps in history.

        Far too many @Wikipedia articles lack photos. That is why it is exciting
        to see this initiative from @WikimediaGH, which went to the Ghanaian
        Parliament and successfully convinced them to donate photos of all 275
        members.
