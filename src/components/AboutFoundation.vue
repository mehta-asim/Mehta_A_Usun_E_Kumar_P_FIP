          We are the people who keep knowledge free. There is an amazing
          community of people around the world that makes great projects like
          Wikipedia. We help them do that work. We take care of the technical
          infrastructure, the legal challenges, and the growing pains.

          More than 550 staff and contractors support Wikimedia projects,

          We share a commitment to free knowledge and work together with our
          community. Volunteer contributors take the lead on editorial
          decisions. Our public policy efforts and research initiatives focus on
          maintaining the legal protections that make that possible.

          The Wikimedia Foundation leadership team oversees departments,
          internal teams, and staff. The Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees
          oversees our work. The Board is the Foundationâ€™s ultimate corporate
          authority.

          Working with partners like Google, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and
          UNESCO, Wikimedia actively seeks new knowledge, closing systemic gaps
          in global understanding of language, culture, and identity.
